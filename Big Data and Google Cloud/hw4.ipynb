    "_According to the **Academic Integrity Policy** of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone else’s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml._\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is an individual assignment for all graduate students. Undergraduate students are allowed to work in pairs and submit one homework assignment per pair. There will be no extra credit given to undergraduate students who choose to work alone. The pairs of students who choose to work together and submit one homework assignment together still need to abide by the Academic Integrity Policy and not share or receive help from others (except each other).\n",
