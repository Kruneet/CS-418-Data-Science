Both Jibaritos came with a huge portion of rice with ham, which was so good I picked up every single kernel...the jibarito was delicious, love the texture contrast between the fried plantain and soft meats, although one might argue the steak version wasn't technically steak (ie not the best cut of meat).

My lovely friend and I stared at the board and we both agreed that everything looked good on the menu (and the restaurant smelled like it was cranking out some good food too).  You could almost call this place The Plantain Stop as the menu is chock full of dishes featuring plantain.  This place is simply designed as a casual dining spot, so first you order your food at the register.  The tables and chairs are pretty basic too, with some interesting items displayed on the walls (Puerto Rico flag guitar, photos etc.).  There is a water dispenser and plastic utensils around the corner from the register. \n\nWe ordered a full jibarito piled with pork, Chihuahua cheese, lettuce / tomato / mayo and finally smeared in garlic.  Rather than the usual long jibarito that is cut in half, they make it into two sort-of sliders, so it is easy to eat and share the jibarito experience.  I loved this platter that comes along with the side of arroz con gandules.  The only minus was that the edges of the jibarito plantain was a bit too chewy, but otherwise this was a delicious ensemble.  We tried the alcapurria, the classic fritter with the plantain / green banana shell stuffed with ground beef.  For kicks and giggles we also tried the pi\u00f1on, described as a Puerto Rican lasagna.  This dish came out piping hot in a tin foil tray, with layers of ground beef, gooey cheese and sweet plantains.  The pi\u00f1on is a rich dish that is simultaneously sweet and savory, and best shared with someone.

I also felt like the shrimp was over cooked because of it. \n\nAll that aside, get here, try the food and support local business!\n"}, {"user_id": "SiSi H.", "rating": 4.0, "date": "2018-08-03", "text": "Today in Chicago we tried to but have a great meal at a Hispanic restaurant.

The steak was juicy and tender and piled high, and the garlicky finish on top of the tostone was the perfect balance. For the Jibarito you are given a choice between chihuahua, American or pepper jack. The arroz con gandules that came with it was so good.

Too bad I never paid any real attention when my bestie taught me how to make it.  To be fair, once she pulled out the homemade sofrito from her grandfather, the lesson was over.  I don't have a Puerto Rican abuelo to make me sofrito and while some people have no problem grabbing a jar from the store, it's just not the same.  \n\nAnyhow, I had known of this food truck, but never managed to catch it and when it was around, they had a long line and I had little patience.  Then, like music to my ears, I heard they were opening up shop in Pilsen.  Be still my heart!  It took awhile to actually try them, because they kept selling out and their hours didn't work with mine, but finally, I tried them.  I don't remember that overwhelming garlic smell the first time (but my breath sure did), but this second time?  Oooooh weeee!  We ordered delivery through GrubHub and I could smell it from the hallway.  \n\nDelicious, delicious garlic.  Split the steak and pork jibarito the first time around and I'm glad I was reminded that I preferred the pork, because once I ate it, I remembered just how tender and juicy it was.  You have 3 or 4 cheese options, though I don't mess with American because gross.  I recommend the chihuahua, but the pepper jack isn't a bad option either, just didn't have a noticeable taste on the sandwich.  I skip the mayo, because also gross.  Keeping that in mind, that means this must be a pretty good jibarito.  \n\nNow, here's where I know they're legit.  I don't give out compliments when it comes to arroz con gandules unless you're my friend's grandmother.  In fact, I've been known to text my friend and say \"tell her I'm eating at (insert restaurant) and their rice isn't as good\" and her response is \"jajaja, ay mija, gracias\" and thinks I'm super sweet.  Well, my friend lives on the north side and I heard grandma isn't making arroz as much these days, so The Jibarito Stop might just have to be where I get my fix.  We hadn't eaten all day and I was in charge of ordering, so this time around I also got a side of arroz blanco con habichuelas (also very good), one alcapurria (good, but should have used a sauce with it), one papa rellena (good, but definitely needed a sauce to help balance the ratio of potato with beef) and a side of pastelon.  I feel like they called it something else, but I can't find it on the menu and it was basically this, so pastelon it is.  I knew what it was, but had never tried it.  At first it was a little too sweet for my liking, but I let it sit for a bit and had it later and couldn't stop eating it.  The sweetness was balanced by the beef and I couldn't believe in the 22 years of knowing my friend AND going to Puerto Rico with her, I had never been introduced to this dish.  \n\nWe ordered a lot, because I was hungry and things sounded good, but it was worth it.  Don't do delivery if you can avoid it (it added around $10 to our bill), but definitely give The Jibarito Stop your business.\n"}, {"user_id": "Angela B.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2017-01-17", "text": "I love this place! they use this amazing garlic sauce to cover everything so the food is incredibly flavorable.

And yes, I live right by Humboldt Park in the middle of a mess of Puerto Rican restaurants; and no, none of them are as good as the Jibarito Stop; and yes, I am aware of the irony of the best jibarito place in town being in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood. \n\nThe Jibarito Stop offers variations on the classic, including chicken, pork, and veggie versions and the option of chihuahua or pepper jack cheese. I am however fiercely loyal to the Chicago original: steak, onions, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and copious amounts of mayonnaise. I deeply appreciate the way the flattened and fried plantain \"bread\" here is always crispy, never limp; I appreciate as well the way they serve the jibaritos on two petite rounds as opposed to the standard larger and more unwieldy whole flattened plantains. \n\nHave I mentioned that I'm a tremendous Plantain Slut? And oh my LARD the maduros here are so good. Crispy, sweet black edges, just like how Mama likes 'em. Skipping a side order of these would be unthinkable. \n\nDoes it get better? Of course it does: the yellow rice and pigeon peas here are not some starchy afterthought, but a delight all on their own: cooked to a perfect chew and spiked with salty bits of bacon.

One last time, you got bodied by a Yelpin' jigga.\n\nI hadn't had The Jibarito Stop when they were just a food truck, so other than simply knowing what the hell a jibarito is, I wasn't sure what to expect. I just knew having a Puerto Rican place in Pilsen was cool. For those of you who don't understand the significance of that statement, this is Puerto Rican food in a largely Mexican (at least for now) 'hood. They are not the same. It's sad I have to explain that to your unworldly ass. \n\nSoon as I got to the crib with the food, they already passed the Puerto Rican cuisine litmus test. I could smell the garlic before taking the food out of the bag. This is a good thing. If you have something against garlic, f**k your two cents unless it's going toward the bill. After almost maiming my mouth by a toothpick I didn't realize was holding the sandwich together because it was camouflaged by the plantain, I realized the taste was definitely there. I enjoyed half a steak and pernil (lech\u00f3n) jibarito. The steak was just fine, but the pernil was Jesus H. f**k good. It's the best lech\u00f3n I've had, no lie. I like that you can chose between 3 different cheeses, because something about melted yellow American cheese on Latin cuisine irks me. I opted for chihuahua, because why wouldn't I? Pepper jack was tempting though. \n\nThe inside of this joint is aesthetically nice, but slightly odd. It's got this very modern feel with just a touch of Latin. It's pretty indicative of Pilsen now. Yanno, \"I'm white but I totes moved here because culture...but not too much culture. I come from money.\"\n\nI'm still bias toward my jibarito spot on Western and Fullerton, but I'll be damned if this dark-horse of a Puerto Rican joint on 18th st. isn't up there with the best of 'em. Them closing early during the early part of their launch, laziness, and being a creature of habit is what took me so long to try them out, but I'm glad I finally did. \n\nIf you're on the north side, stay where you are. You're probably annoying anyway. If you're on the south side and want Puerto Rican food, here you go.

It was acceptable- the vegetables were tasty, but there was definitely something missing. At places like this it's hard to ignore that meats are the star of the show, so omitting them makes a big difference. I think it's great they have a vegetarian option, but think they could do better.

For those who don't know, a jibarito is a sandwich with meat (usually steak, can be pork or chicken), cheese, lettuce, tomato, and garlic mayo. The big game changer is it uses plantains instead of bread, which is sturdier than bread and provides a satisfying break when you bite into it. It's an original of the Chicago Puerto Rican community.\n\nMy first jibarito experience was at the Taste of Chicago, so obviously I've started at the bottom and worked my way up. While Pilsen is more Mexican while Humboldt is Puerto Rican, the jibarito holds up well in unfamiliar territory. Most jibaritos I've had have been overly greasy, and hard to manage. Here they're not greasy at all and are wisely pre-cut in half. I'm still not sure if I liked the steak or pork better because both were great. Also, the arroz con gandules (yellow rice with peas and ham) is a definite must.\n\nWhile it seems they've retired their food truck, they've gone from a place you hunt down to a must-visit shop.

My mistake.  Growing up eating jibaritos and a plethora of Borinque\u00f1a delights I had certain expectations.  Those expectations were not met in any way, shape, or form.  I feel like what they are serving is a perverted interpretation of what Puerto Rican food is.  The habichuelas had far too much cilantro in them and the wrong flavor profile.  The fact that they make the tostones for the sandwich in circles should have been a clue that something was wrong.  The steak and chicken for the jibaritos were boiled and flavorless. The steak was seasoned well, but in the end it was just boiled salted steak.  Jibaritos truly shine when the meat is ROASTED/GRILLED.  Traditionally the mojo, or garlic sauce, is always made with raw garlic.  The mojo sauce on the jibaritos we ordered tasted like sweet roasted garlic and was PINK!?  The arroz con gandules was terrible, it tasted too much like smoked ham, you could taste nothing but smoked pork and not in a good way.  The maduro wasn't cooked all the way.  The other fried offerings were completely off and tasted nothing like Puerto Rican food.  We also got the empanadas.  Note to self, Puerto Ricans don't make vegetable empanadas for a reason.  The beef empanada was actually not bad, probably the best thing we had from there.  The shrimp empanadas were a serious let down especially considering the up charge and the fact that they were unseasoned and filled with potatoes.  YES!  THAT'S RIGHT!  Shrimp empanadas with POTATOES in them, smh.  Why charge more for a potato empanada with shrimp seasoning, that's disrespectful.  The sauces were terrible, not even worth the time it would take to break it down.  I can understand why someone who has never had any Puerto Rican food or an Jibarito before would think this is good, but anyone, and I mean ANYONE that has ever had a real Jibarito would be disappointed in the offering from this restaurant.  This is Puerto Rican food for the uninitiated.  If you closed your eyes and ate this you would think you were at a bad Mexican restaurant, which may not be too far off from the truth.  They get 1 star for pretending to be something they're not, which is a Puerto Rican Restaurant.  They need to make the trek up to Humboldt Park for a learning experience and then adjust their menu and execution accordingly.

The twin mini-sandwiches (I had expected one larger sandwich) were tasty enough, but messy to deal with -- the fresh tomato and lettuce and the unneeded garlic mayonnaise instantly wilted on contact with the hot meat, producing major drippage. BTW this was not one or two slices of steak, as I had imagined, but a handful of tiny meat pieces -- OK I suppose. \n\nI was less pleased with the other items. Normally I LOVE maduros -- delicate pillows of sweet fried goodness. These were underripe and very dark, as if they were cooked in bad oil, or too long, or both. Yellow rice was dry and sticky. My shrimp empanada had a good flavor but, again, was dark brown instead of golden brown. \n\nThis is counter service cooked to order -- not fast food -- so don't go in a big hurry.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Staff were friendly. The music wasn't painfully loud, but loud enough that I couldn't quite hear what they were saying. \n\nPS while the address listed is correct, don't go by the map that pops up when you click on Yelp's direction link.

After waiting 20 minutes in line during my lunch hour they announced that they'd ran out of steak. I left without ordering.\n\nI was in the area today and decided to go back. Overall, I'll pass. There was no line so I was excited. Ordered the steak jibarito with white rice and beans. After getting my food, I was surprised it was served on a paper plate, but I thought \"ok-they just opened\". After digging into my food I was immediately regretful. The rice and beans were good, but I couldn't really enjoy because it was extremely salty. The jibarito was a generous size, but was lackluster at best. The steak had no flavor. Highlight of my meal was the Cola Champagne I ordered.\n\nI'm Puerto Rican so I was definitely looking forward to the food since its in my area.

But I didn't let the rude wait staff deter me.  I ordered the empa\u00f1ada basket, which was a total of close to $10. I was handed a small container of rice and 2 small empa\u00f1adas, the empa\u00f1adas were freshly hot and pretty good.  But The arroz con granules was a bit under cooked. For 10$.. \n\nI mean, picture this..  Your whole life, you've known arroz con grandules to be well seasoned Moist and al dente.  Picture shattered! I asked the cook about the rice and he literally sucked his teeth and sighed. I understand, you probably worked incredibly hard on the rice.  And it still didn't turn out the way, intended.  I wasn't offering a whole new order to replace it.  \n\nWhile the wait time was just about 12 mins, (which was totally fine because, I needed time gather myself and eat before heading to a meeting) The scenery of the lobby was dimly lit and had some pretty good room for seating.  Not exactly a full house in the afternoon where in lunch..  Most of the strip is crawling with people.  But this was full only by the definition of just 2 small tables that were full. I'd says it's intimate enough if you're looking for a window view.  \nDetail by scenery: the windows weren't clean,and the floor looked like it hadn't been swepted or mopped.  And when I inquired about a restroom the cook in the back ( a younger short dark haired man) looked directly passed me. All of 25mins of being in this place, not only did I feel unwelcome.  Nothing says unwelcome than paying $10 for under cooked food and wait staff who don't know how to use their words. \nNow.. To my understanding, it took the owners (2 Latinas from the other side of the city) a hot minute to get the establishment up. That's neither here nor there.  Because What's absolutely unacceptable is, the attitude of their wait staff and the very lack of cleanliness..  \nIf the crowd dies down or is just slow paced kinda day, you'll have walk the time in the world to catch up on simple spot cleaning.  \n\nHere's a tip: \nwe Southsiders are prettttty forgiving in these cases.  Yes, there's a plethora of problems that are totally common in restaurants, however that doesn't absolve you of a responsibility that you owed, to the general public. While There's much potential to grow here and there's room for everyone.  Let's be real, it can get really lonely during those winter hours, having a so uno customers, and last time I checked.  Having only 2 full tables out such a generous space isn't for exactly \"making it\" ..  So if you want our services, act right.  Train your staff and check your condescending attitudes and entitlement before you come to work.  This is literally how you lose customers regardless of how far they travel to come to frequent your space.  Lastly, CLEAN YOUR STORE!\n"}, {"user_id": "Mari P.", "rating": 1.0, "date": "2016-03-29", "text": "This place is horrible. The pork was dry they barley put any in the platter it was more rice then anything. When I relieved it three grub hub the grease was spilled everywhere. The only park that was good was the one piece of skin I got on the pork platter. Will not be going here and I will make sure I tell people it's horrible.\n"}, {"user_id": "Stan V.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2016-05-15", "text": "Living in Pilsen, I heard of this place a million times. I had to try it. I ordered a steak jabarito to go. They were really nice people and the food was amazing. I don't just through around five stars... I think they were that  great. The cooks looked a little grumpy, lol, buy hey... that's fine. They make amazing food, you can be grumpy:)  I highly recommend them.\n"}, {"user_id": "Sarah C.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2015-11-10", "text": "The Jibarito Stop just opened up a new restaurant a few blocks from my work, and I couldn't be more excited.  Always on the lookout for new lunch places and eager to support new local businesses, myself and the rest of the folks in my office decided to order take out and give it a go.  The reviews were unanimous... the food was delicious.  Given that the name of the restaurant is the Jibarito Stop, I figured I had no choice but to try a Jibarito.  I was a little skeptical on the combination of ingredients (not being a huge plantain fan), but figured \"when in Rome!\".  I couldn't have been happier with my choice.  I chose a Steak Jibarito, which comes with a big ol' serving of arroz con gandules (rice with pigeon peas).  The steak was wonderfully seasoned, and the plantain \"bun\" gave it just the right flavor.  Very happy to see such a great addition to the neighborhood and looking forward to trying some more items from the menu!\n"}, {"user_id": "Dan O.", "rating": 5.0, "date": "2016-03-29", "text": "This food was amazing, so much so that I had to write a yelp review!  The veggie jibarito rocked my world and even the white rice and beans were well seasoned.  I want to come back!

I thought I had given The Jibarito Stop their 5 star reviews ages ago!  \nI started off frequenting The Jibarito Stop when they were a food truck in the Loop.  They have, hands down, the best beef and cheese empanadas. Now that their store front is open in Pilsen, The Jibarito Stop is finally able to serve their name sake sandwich.  My go to is the steak jibarito. It is piled with tender, flavorful steak and topped with your choice of cheese.  You cannot go wrong with this classic.  I have my husband stop in every 6 weeks on his way home from getting a hair cut near Bridgeport.  The food is so good I don't even care that it is usual cold by the time I make it home from work. I don't think there is much higher praise than still good when room temp!  \nSo trust me, go get a jibarito and some beef empanadas and if there is flan available, grab that too.  You can thank me when you wake from your food coma\n"}, {"user_id": "Jessica G.", "rating": 2.0, "date": "2016-03-10", "text": "Not the best puerto rican food.

There aren't a lot of Puerto Rican restaurants in the South Loop/Pilsen and this place is a godsend. I had the steak jibarito which was delicious. It came with yummy yellow rice with peas. The empanadas are unbelievable. You have to order them. They're huge! We also had the fried plantains (rostones) and they were great too. There just weren't alot of them. Lastly, we had the whipped potatoes as a side. I was surprised because they were COLD. I think that is how they are supposed to be served but I wasn't expecting it.other than that, this place is a very value and I'll be back!\n"}]
